I've build a Github Repositories Listing Page in which user github repositories data is fetched, a maximum of 100 repositories 
and 10 repositories per page can be shown with user profile, bio, Github account link.

When user searches for his repository at that time also loader is shown and when user has searched for his Github account 
repositories then while fetching data loader will be shown. Wherever API calls are made, then loader will be shown.

Also in the bottom of the page user can switch between pages from 1 to 10 which will show 100 repositories data in which one 
page contains 10 repositories. 

This page is completed made using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
